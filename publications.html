                               Some systems cannot be predicted by classical theories and require the development of combined deterministic and stochastic theories that make use of noise for their dynamical prediction. Noise is not always an interfering signal which perturbs the system, it can also enhance its performance. This property can be observed through Stochastic Resonance (SR), To detect this phenomena it is necessary a system with bistable potential barrier with a threshold, the input of the system should be a weak periodic signal which amplitude is below threshold together with a stochastic signal. The behaviour of the SR is detected in a neural network and it is studied under noise color variations. Here it is found that Pink noise amplifies the sub-threshold input signal twenty times more in comparison to white noise. This could be evidence of the functionality of background noise in the brain, where neurons are naturally embedded in pink noise.

                               This paper describes the model for DNA in MATLAB taking into account all of component atoms. In this model, it is possible to 
				       generate sequences with length 10000 basis pairs available for introducing all types of sequences. Once the strands are 
				       generated, it is studied the DNA damage in the single strand and double strand. The damage are outcomes of ionising 
				       radiation of X-rays when interacting with the DNA immersed in water. This is a theoretical and experimental in-vitro 
				       study that quantifies the single strand and double strand damage for different doses of radiation. This can be useful to 
				       predict the exact risks of expositions to radiations. In simulations, it is taken into account the damage caused by free 
				       electrons generated by the effect of the interaction with the water molecules, this is different to the effect considered 
				       in radiobiology, where indirect damages are due to chemical reactions. The spatial distribution of the electrons is 
				       obtained from Geant4 and here this distribution is used for the creation of rays as three-dimensional random trajectories 
				       through Monte Carlo simulations. It is also presented the experimental DNA damage through radiating DNA samples immersed 
				       in water with a X-rays unit with Molybdenum target. The damage level is quantified through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). 
				       It is possible to conclude a direct relation between the damage and the radiation doses with the experimental results.
