          <h3>Master's thesis: <i>Wave to Pulse transformation. From oscillatory synapse to train of action potentials</i></h3> 
          <span>
          <b>Abstract:</b> <i>There are two types of neural communication, interneuron and intraneural. The former is explained by the wave to pulse transform: from dendritic analog signals to a pulse of action potential where the Hebbian rule applies, and the later is explained by chemical and electrical excitatory and inhibitory synapses where poissonian statistics are used to predict the action of the pre-synapse to the response on the post-synapse. Here, I propose a novel model for the interneuron communication as an oscillatory transformation where the general inhibitory or excitatory state, is the result of destructive and constructive wave pattern synchronization.</i></br>

          <h3>Bachelor's thesis: <i>Stochastic Resonance in Neural Network, Noise Color Effects</i></h3> 
          <span>
          <b>Abstract:</b> <i>In theoretical and experimental physics, it is common practice to do linear approximations to solve non-linear problems. These approximations have given satisfactory results, that until certain margin of error, theoretical analysis and linear numerical methods agree with observed experimental findings. However, measurements are subject to the same linear approximations as numerical methods which require the validation of current models. Often, experimental data which does not match with known models, is considered to be subject to noise and eliminated from the average trend of the data. This deletion of the noisy data is done due to the complexity of noise and limited theoretical tools to analyze them. In addition, models and experimental devices are constrained to implicit linearizations.Real physical phenomena is intrinsically non-linear and its dynamics modulated in a noisy environment. An example is the nervous system, a highly non-linear system  which is embedded in a noisy biological environment dependent on multiple interactions, for example, channel opening which is only triggered by precise stimulus like voltage, pH or the binding of a ligand, its poisson like distribution allows coherence in the brain. The nervous system is also a detection device whose input signals are strongly immersed in a continuous noise, which comes from the external environment through the sensory neurons. The nervous system is acting as a decoder of noisy input output information by computing small signals embedded in fluctuating noisy conditions. Enhancement and amplification of those fluctuations is a relevant candidate to explain perception.</i>
