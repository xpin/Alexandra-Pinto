          Bachelor's thesis.

          <h3>Ph.D. thesis: <i>Self-Adaptive Solutions for Managing Performance and Power Consumption of Parallel Applications</i></h3> 
          <span>
          <b>Abstract:</b> <i>Power consumption management in computing systems is gaining an increasing attention due to its environmental and economic impact. On one side, it
has been estimated that CO 2 emissions of U.S. data centers during 2010 were
on par with those of an entire country like Argentina. On the other side, the
cost of the energy required to keep the system running is quickly going to
overcome the cost of the physical system itself. Despite the improvements in
the hardware technology, a proper management of the applications running
on top of that hardware is still of paramount importance, since estimations
show that the power demand of datacenter will rapidly grow 10% - 12% per
year. Power consumption is an important issue even on smaller devices. For
example, on mobile devices, an efficient power management leads to a longer
battery life and to a better user experience. As a consequence, a better battery
management would enable the diffusion of more complex and richer applications.
In this thesis, we focus on scenarios where the user wants to express specific Quality of Service (QoS) requirements on his application, regarding performance and power consumption. Requirements can be enforced by using
self-adaptive algorithms, to dynamically and automatically adapt the number of
resources allocated to the application (i.e., its configuration). To select a proper
configuration, most existing approaches rely either on heuristics or on machine
learning models. While heuristics may work fine in general, they are usually
less accurate than machine learning solutions. On the other hand, despite being more accurate than heuristics, machine learning techniques typically require extensive training phases to be performed offline, before the application
starts its execution. Moreover, machine learning techniques may not be able
to find a suitable configuration for applications with characteristics different
from those of the applications used to train the models.
In this thesis we try to close the gap between these two approaches, by
proposing an online learning algorithm which, like the heuristics, will not rely
on any training phase to be performed offline and, at the same time, can achieve the same accuracy of complex offline machine learning approaches. Since a
simulation would not capture all the runtime related overheads introduced by
such algorithms, we designed and implemented a full software stack (released
as open source), ranging from the management of hardware control mechaisms to parallel applications to be used as benchmarks. This led to the design
of Nornir, a framework to be used by application users to enforce explicit performance and power consumption requirements on their applications. Nornir
can be customized by algorithms designers to implement new self-adaptive
strategies easily and to compare them with the state of the art algorithms already provided by the framework. Eventually, we will show that if the application has some clear and well-defined structure, it would be possible for
the algorithms to select better configurations regarding power/performance
tradeoffs.</i></br>

          <h3>Master's thesis: <i>DPI Over Commodity Hardware: Implementation of a Scalable Framework Using FastFlow</i></h3> 
          <span>
          <b>Abstract:</b> <i>The target of this thesis is to explore the possibility to apply structured parallel programming theory to support the implementation of a Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) framework. We have shown that, using structured parallel programming concepts and with an accurate design, we are able to do stateful packet inspection over current network rates using commodity multicore hardware and to achieve a good speedup and results comparable to those obtained by dedicated hardware.</i>
          </br>
          The thesis lead to the creation of the <i>Peafowl</i> Deep Packet Inspection engine. The developed source code can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/DanieleDeSensi/Peafowl">here</a>.</br>

          <b>Abstract:</b> <i>The target of this work is the implementation of a library for the parallel execution of Macro Data Flow graphs over shared memory architectures. Beside the possibility to express generic flow graphs, the library provides some well known patterns as farm, pipeline, map, reduce and any possible combination among them.</i>
