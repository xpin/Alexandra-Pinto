          <h2>Research Interests</h2>
          <span>
            I have a special interest in Artificial Intelligence, information transmission, and computation. I enjoy doing so by combining interdisciplinary 
		  research between Software Engineering, Management, and Business-Customer negotiations. I like modeling nonlinear physical phenomena in hardware
		  and software networks and tackling data science problems for different market sectors. I have a solid background in Bayesian networks, 
		  Statistics, and Theoretical Neurosciences for Machine Learning applications.
	 <br/>
	 <br/>
	 During my master studies at Zurich, I specialized in coursework for research on Neural Systems and Computation, with an emphasis on Neural Computation 
		  and Information theory, in addition, the Neurotechnologies, Neuromorphic Engineering, and Quantum Information Processing. I am particularly 
		  interested in long-range correlations as can be observed in EEG signals and in modeling synaptic signaling for dynamic phase transitions.

		<li><a href=""> I  had  experience  in  experimental  physics, exploring  naturally  occurring  noise  in  VO2,  which  was  a  very  
			delicate  signal  that  needed  careful  isolation of  noise  using  braided  gold  cables,  this  signal  explained  the  coupling  
			of  electrons  in  this  material  as  it  was immersed  in  liquid  nitrogen,  the  signal  acquisition  was  made  with  an  spectrum  
			analyzer  and  Labview,  the data  was  later  processed  using  Matlab.  As  my  senior  research  project,  I  studied  the  effects  of  
			noise  in  an artificial  neuron,  studying  how  different  kinds  of  noise  caused  amplification  of  an  input  signal,  data  was 
			automatically  taken  using  Labview  to  control  the  input  to  the  system  and  to  take  data,  which  was  later processed  with  
			Matlab.  I  also  studied  the  effect  of  X-rays  on  DNA  damage,  I  developed  a  3D  model  of DNA in  Matlab  based  on  PDB  data,  
			where  each  atom  is  identified,  located  in  space  and  ion  radius  is assigned.  The  program  can  create  a  straight  DNA  strand  
			of  any  length  given  a  string  of  nitrogen  bases.  Strands  as  long  as  10.000  nitrogen  bases  with  a  total  of  6'370.000  atoms
			were  created  to  estimate  the damage  that  X-rays  cause.  To  simulate  X-rays  realistically  the  program  GEANT4  was  used  to  get  
			the spatial  distribution of HO- and H+ after X-rays  go through water. My last research experience is with  emphasis  in  Neural Computation
			and  Theoretical  Neurosciences,  in  addition  to  Neurotechnologies  and  Neuromorphic Engineering.</a></li>
