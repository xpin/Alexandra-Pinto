          <h2>Research Interests</h2>
          <span>
            I have special interest in Artificial Intelligence and in pushing forward the boundaries of information transmission
		  and computation. I enjoy doing so by combining interdisciplinary research, team work and entrepreneurship. I 
		  have found that my maximum achievements are in positions where I am a bridge between Software Engineering 
		  Management and Business-Customer negotiations. I like modeling nonlinear physical phenomena in hardware and 
		  software networks and tackling data science problems for different market sectors. I have a solid background 
		  in Bayesian networks, Statistics and Theoretical Neurosciences for Machine Learning applications.
            <br/>
		<br/>
              During my master studies at Zurich, I specialised in coursework for research on Neural Systems and Computation, 
		  with emphasis in Neural Computation and Information theory, in addition to Neurotechnologies, Neuromorphic 
		  Engineering and Quantum Information Processing. I would like to explain the neural information transmission 
		  and processes with a solid theoretical foundation. I am particularly interested in long range correlations as 
		  can be observed in EEG signals given that these signals are measured simultaneously in different parts of the 
		  skull but they correspond to the same functional task. I found a relationship between a proposed synaptic 
		  model and what could be seen as a possible mesoscopic scale phase transition prediction by considering long 
		  range correlations through the Bose Einstein condensate with interesting intersection with Quantum Phenomena.
