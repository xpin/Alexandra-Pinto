                  I'm an information theorist, physicist and entrepreneur.
		  I am specialized in Neural Systems and Computation with Quantum Information background. <br/
                  My academic coursework is from ETH Zurich, UZH Zurich, Stanford University and Los Andes University and the 
	          Swiss Innovation Agency, Innosuisse. I was also part of Creative Destruction Lab at Toronto where I got close
		  contact to the Quantum Computing ecosystem and customer's needs.</p>

                   My main research interest is in Neuroscience and how its learning and memory mechanisms can be useful for enhanced artificial 
	           computation that allows greener, smarter machine learning deployment.<br/> 
                   I design computational tools for machine learning and data science for the development of efficient algorithms
	           that solve enterprises learning and inference requirements. I use inspiration from physical phenomena and 
		   neuroscience. <br/
	           Passionate about Neuroscience and it’s interceptions with Technology and Data Science. I see the brain as a 
	           matrix or operator which performs a transformation (like a Fourier Transform), that takes all external signals and 
	           transforms them in a world were there are only three dimensions for space, one for time, but N-dimensions for sound,
	           flavor, colors etc. In some strange way, our brains build a space that helps us make sense of the world and how we 
		   interact with it. For me the brain is like an unexplored black box, we take the outside world as input and produce 
		   physical laws and theories as output. However, in the theoretical models we have created, we have not considered us
		   as interpreters of the world, and therefore all our knowledge is limited to our senses. This is why my main interest 
		   is people, I care for the bias of perception and judgement specially in technology with massive effects through 
		   Data Science, learning, creativity and the crucial issue of time perception.  A set of my interdisciplinary 
	           publications can be found at <a href="./publications.html">publications page</a></p>
